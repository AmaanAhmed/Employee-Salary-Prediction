## [1. Documentation](https://github.com/AmaanAhmed/Employee-Salary-Prediction/blob/main/Documentation.md) <br>

This documentation file outlines a comprehensive study on utilizing machine learning techniques for predicting employee salaries. It covers data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation, as well as insightful conclusions. The study compares various regression models, with the Random Forest regressor emerging as the most accurate. The document also addresses limitations and proposes avenues for future research.

## [2. Complete Code with Explanation and Output](https://github.com/AmaanAhmed/Employee-Salary-Prediction/blob/main/Complete%20Code%20with%20Output%20and%20Explanation.ipynb) <br>

The "Complete Code with Explanations and Outputs" file encompasses the entirety of our project's codebase, thoughtfully annotated to provide clear explanations for each operation. This includes even the minutest details, ensuring accessibility for individuals without prior programming knowledge. Additionally, comprehensive outputs are provided, affording a thorough understanding of the code's execution.

## [3. Extra](https://github.com/AmaanAhmed/Employee-Salary-Prediction/tree/main/Extra) <br>

Within the repository, you'll find an "Extra" folder housing two supplementary files. The first contains solely the unadorned source code - devoid of any commentary, explanations, or output snippets. It presents the code in its purest, raw form. The second file mirrors the Jupyter Notebook "Complete Code with Explanations and Outputs," but is formatted in Markdown. This alternative format caters to individuals with a preference for this style. Feel free to overlook the "Extra" folder if it's not relevant to your needs.
